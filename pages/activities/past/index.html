		        	<p>Project: Classification of Recipes by Cuisine<br>
					Project Managers: Lingmiao Qiu, Joshua Hayes<br>
					Active Members: Joseph Mugisha, Omar Aguilar, Santi EspinosaDeLosReyes,  Thang Le, Wallace He
					<p>
					Outline: The goal was to classify a list of recipes extracted from Yummly into the correct Cuisine category. Each recipe had an ID number and a list of ingredients. The training data had the correct cuisine labels. The test data did not.
					<p>
					The first method tried was K-Means clustering. The second method tried was weighting each ingredient based on how often it appeared in training recipes of each cuisine type, summing these weights up for the ingredients in the recipes, and choosing the corresponding cuisine. This algorithm gave a 62% accuracy rating on the final test data from the Kaggle competition website. The final method tried was using Logistic Regression in Octave, giving an accuracy of 78% - which would've placed them 633rd out of 1388 people. The highest accuracy rating achieved was 83%.
					<p>
					Here are some examples of ingredients that were strongly indicative of their respective cuisine's:
					<p>
					Brazilian: Hawaiian salt, Sugar in the Raw, Acai Juice<br>
					British: Colman's Mustard Powder, Cox's Orange Pippin, India Pale Ale<br> 
					Cajun Creole: Alexia Waffle Fries, Camellia Red Kidney Beans, Dole Seven Lettuces<br>
					Chinese: 33% less sodium smoked fully cooked ham, Argo Corn Starch, Chinese Rice Vinegar<br>
