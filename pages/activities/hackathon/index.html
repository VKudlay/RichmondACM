					This was UR's first hackathon, local or not. During this event, people come out and develop products with a team during a 12-hour timeframe. This year, the themes were UR and Social Good. There were food, prizes, and goodies at the event! For food, we had breakfast, lunch, and dinner where dinner was Chick Fil A and warm cookies from Insomnia. The goodies were stickers of the logo above.

					First place was the team from Deep Run, CIT Teens. Their app was to prevent drunk texting where you have to answer questions before you could text someone. If they had more time, they would add whitelisted contacts and a way to call an Uber/Lyft.

					Second place was the team Sphero. Their website was about connecting tutors and students, and they had a database running with their website.

					Third place was the team Big Boys and Girls. Their app was about combinging studying and alarms. Professors would send in questions from their class to pose as questions to answer when your alarm goes off - making you energized and ready to take on the day.
